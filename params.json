{"name":"Supply drop","body":"# supply_drop\r\n\r\nsupply_drop is a capistrano plugin to facitiate provisioning servers with puppet, without using the puppet server. It works by simply rsyncing your puppet configuration files to your servers and running puppet apply. It strives to allow you to write idiomatic puppet scripts while being as lightweight as possible.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n    gem install supply_drop\r\n\r\nor with Bundler\r\n\r\n    gem 'supply_drop'\r\n\r\nthen at the top of your deploy.rb\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'supply_drop'\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n\r\n    cap puppet:bootstrap:ubuntu\r\n    cap puppet:bootstrap:osx\r\n    cap puppet:bootstrap:redhat\r\n\r\nThis does a simple apt-get install of puppet on the target servers.\r\n\r\n    cap puppet:noop\r\n\r\nThis will show you a list of the pending changes to be applied server-by-server.\r\n\r\n    cap puppet:apply\r\n\r\nApplies the pending changes to all the servers.\r\n\r\n    cap puppet:syntax_check\r\n\r\nLocally syntax checks all the puppet files and erb templates. Requires you to have puppet installed locally.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can specify that one of your servers should not be puppeted by setting the :nopuppet flag to true, like so. It will then be skipped by all the above commands.\r\n\r\n    role :weird_thing, '33.33.33.33', :nopuppet => true\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nThere are several variables that can be overriden to change how supply_drop works:\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_source, '.'\r\n\r\ndefines the base directory containing your puppet configs that will be rsynced to the servers.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_destination, '/tmp/supply_drop'\r\n\r\ndefines where on the server the puppet configuration files are synced to.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_command, 'puppet apply'\r\n\r\nallows you to override the puppet command that is run if puppet is not on the path.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_lib, \"#{puppet_destination}/modules\"\r\n\r\nthe value of the PUPPETLIB environment variable, the location of your puppet modules.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_parameters, 'puppet.pp'\r\n\r\nthe parameters that are passed to the puppet call.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_excludes, %w(.git .svn)\r\n\r\nthese are patterns that are passed as rsync --exclude flags when pushing your puppet configs to the box.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_parallel_rsync, true\r\n\r\ndetermines whether the rsync commands for multiple servers are run in parallel threads or serially\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_syntax_check, false\r\n\r\nwhen true, will syntax check your puppet files and erb templates before rsyncing them to your servers. This is an\r\nexperimental feature and is quite slow at the moment.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_stream_output, false\r\n    \r\nwill write the incremental output from the hosts to the screen instead of waiting until complete and printing by host.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_write_to_file, nil\r\n\r\na file to additionally write puppet output to, useful for large noops with small scrollbacks.\r\n\r\n    set :puppet_runner, nil\r\n\r\nallows you to specify the user to execute the puppet command as. Like running sudo -u puppet args from the command line.\r\n\r\n### Handling Legacy Puppet\r\n\r\nPuppet deprecated the implicit invocation of apply [in the 2.6.x series](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/commit/a23cfd869f90ae4456dded6e5a1c82719b128f01).\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of supply_drop includes `apply` keyword in its commands, but if you need compatibility with older versions of puppet, set the `puppet_command` variable to omit it.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to do this if you see errors like this:\r\n\r\n    Could not parse for environment production: Could not find file /home/.../supply_drop/apply.pp\r\n\r\n### How to contribute\r\n\r\nIf you write anything complicated, write a test for it. Test that your changes work using vagrant. Send a pull request. Easy peezy.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n* Paul Hinze [phinze](https://github.com/phinze \"github\")\r\n* Paul Gross [pgr0ss](https://github.com/pgr0ss \"github\")\r\n* Drew Olson [drewolson](https://github.com/drewolson \"github\")\r\n* Dave Pirotte [dpirotte](https://github.com/dpirotte \"github\")\r\n* Dan Manges [dan-manges](https://github.com/dan-manges \"github\") (one soda's worth)\r\n","tagline":"masterless puppet using capistrano","google":"UA-30834037-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
